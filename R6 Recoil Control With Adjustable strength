       HOW TO USE FOR DUMBIES, 
  (RC)
1: If the  "EnableRCS" is set to false, change to true.
2: Adjust your Recoil Control Strength, either by using a preset or a custom value!
3: Toggle it on (if you have ForceToggle enabled, else just do step 4.)
4: Hold Mouse1 and Mouse2 (LeftClick and RightClick) and it should drag your cursor downwards.
5: Aim at your target and you're done!

(Things to note)
1: I did NOT make the Recoil Control Code, I just simplified everything, so you can adjust it to your needs.
2: You don't need to hold down your toggle key, it's a toggle.
3: You must hold mouse1 and mouse2, or else IT WON'T WORK!
4: DelayRate works in MS, the lower the faster. 7ms = 0.07s, 2000ms = 2s. However, the preset Delay rate is perfect for most FPS games.
